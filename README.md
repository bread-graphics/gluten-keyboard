Keyboard Types
==============

Contains types to define keyboard related events.

This crate is a fork of the [`keyboard-types`][keyboard-types] crate with two major changes:

- The crate is made `no_std` and no-`alloc` compatible.
- The `webdriver` part is removed.

This crate was forked due to the [current lack of `no_std` support](https://github.com/pyfisch/keyboard-types/issues/17) on the original crate.
